		<description><![CDATA[I am sorry, I laughed hard to the term &quot;low maintenance fee&quot;. Because I just calculated, if I cloudmine for XMR, my maintenance fee is greater than what I profit. Don&#039;t even try. And, funny thing, it says that min withdrawal for , i.e FCN is 0.01, but the funny thing is, in order for it to be confirmed you have to mine 1 FCN. It&#039;s just, they probably have reserved seats in hell or they directly work with them.. Just so you know..]]></description>

I thought was a glitch I mail support they said no discrepancy ..seriously. they expect over 1/3 your money in mining fees? difficulty increase 2 times a month not long before contract is gone ..AND before that will take forever to get .01 to withdraw. SCAM they think we cannot do a thing about it lol .. we will see.]]></description>
