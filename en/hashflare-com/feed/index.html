		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been using Hashflare for 6 months and have nothing but praise for it. The ROI is brilliant. The best way to make some money for you future is to reinvest your profits and let it do it&#039;s thing for a long term. I started with an investment of $50 and it doubled within the first 40 days. I started reinvesting my mined BTCâ€™s which provided me with a high return. 6 months in, I&#039;m making more than $200 a month.

		<description><![CDATA[Happy new year!! The year of the cryptocurrency :)

I&#039;ve been using Hashflare for a short while (6 months) I would say that the ROI from the site is incredible. The best way I can see you making anything on it is to reinvest your profits and let it do it&#039;s thing for a long term investment. Recently they have increased the price for the contracts, even still it&#039;s highly profitable, not comparable to anything Iâ€™ve seen before. I started with an investment of $50 and it doubled within the first 40 days. I started reinvesting my mined BTCâ€™s which provided me with a high return. 6 months in, I&#039;m making more than $200 a month.

		<description><![CDATA[Happy new year!! The year of the cryptocurrency :)

I&#039;ve now been using Hashflare for a short while (6 months) I would say that the ROI from the site is incredible. The best way I can see you making anything on it is to reinvest your profits and let it do it&#039;s thing for a long term investment. I have been working in asset management for more than a decade and until now, never seen such a promising risk-return-profile! Hashflare is an amazing cloud mining company, they are really reliable especially since HashCoins provides them with SHA-256. Recently they increased the price for the contracts, even still it&#039;s highly profitable, not comparable to anything Iâ€™ve seen before. I initially started with an investment of $50 and it doubled within the first 42 days. After taking out my initial investment, I started reinvesting my mined BTCâ€™s which provided me with a tremendously high return. By now, I make more than $200 a month, only thanks to running the Cloud Mining in the background.

You can start with investments as little as 2.20$ for an SHA-256 (bitcoin mining) contract and make incredible gains in a few weeks/months. So, I highly recommend everyone who has some cash laying around in their bank accounts with no interest on it to give Hashflare a try.

		<description><![CDATA[Hashflare has been in the cloud mining industry for about 2 years now and one of the trusted cloud mining company to invest in and one of my personal choice because of the reinvest function which enables you to automatically reinvest your daily earnings for additional hashing power, which means more daily income.

		<description><![CDATA[Honest review: Hashflare has been doing pretty well lately, their payouts have been quite amazing tbh, I am topping at $240 a day, it should be like $190 but I used the bonus payout link: 
https://hashflare.io/r/21C96275-newyear
I will keep it real, hashflareâ€™s support sucks, it takes time for them to solve any issue you have. They got customizable pools, I honestly suggest putting it to AntPool when you sign up, I feel like you get the most profit with them. The bitcoin withdrawals take a few hours. Overal hashflare isnâ€™t a scam overall, They pay well and RoI has been a long time ago.
Get your bonus here:

		<description><![CDATA[Hi guys!
Stay alert from news websites they&#039;re not real companies. I made another withdraw with HashFlare just one hour ago and it still work like a charm. I got 6+ confirmation after 20 minutes!
I believe in blockchain so I think that mining it&#039;s a good way to earn some BTC and HashFlare is a leader since 2014 with a solid company.
If you want to join in mining cloud I suggest to use this link for registration and discount code on purchase in order to get the 10% of discount (every discount code works in the same way and amount...)

https://hashflare.io/r/8FB4E262 (DISCOUNT CODE: 8FB4E262)

For any question you can write a reply, I&#039;ll be happy to answer.
Happy holiday and mining! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Overall i am quite satisfied with HashFlare. Their interface is easy to use and visualize. The ability to auto-reinvest is a nice feature that makes day to day management easier. The increments that you can buy hash rate in is of an appealing amount.

		<description><![CDATA[Merry Christmas, everyone! :)
Here&#039;s my review of Hashflare. I have been using it for the last 11 months by now and although they had some minor technical difficulties due to the high demand and some new regulations, overall it is an incredible alternative investment. I have been working in asset management for more than a decade and until now, never seen such a promising risk-return-profile! Hashflare is an amazing cloud mining company, they are really reliable especially since hashcoins provides them with SHA-256. Their withdraw system is really easy to use and you can actually withdraw a customizable amount, even on a daily basis. A few days ago, they increased the price for the contracts, it still is highly profitable, not comparable to anything I&#039;ve seen before. I initially started with an investment of 2&#039;000$ and it doubled within the first 42 days. After taking out my initial investment, I started reinvesting my mined BTC&#039;s which provided me with a tremendously high return. By now, I make more than 12k a month, only thanks to running the Cloud Mining in the background. 
The set up of an account is easy and does not require any confirmation of residency or scans of your passport. It took me like 3 minutes to create the account and transfer my initial investment. I did it with my credit card but there&#039;s also the possibility of a bank transfer, which may take a few days to process. Once the money arrived, you&#039;ll automatically start to mine. 
Regarding the reliability of Hashflare, compared to other Cloud Miners in the market, they excel with their transparency, great customer service and they keep their customers informed through several channels, such as Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, where they post their mining farm photos and update people and whats going on. Furthermore, Hashflare as a company has been highly profitable since their foundation, which reduces the risk of a bankruptcy.  
In conclusion, it is a highly profitable, easy to use investment opportunity, with an extremely low-risk profile. You can start with investments as little as 2.20$ for an SHA-256 (bitcoin mining) contract and make incredible gains in a few weeks/months. So, I highly recommend everyone who has some cash laying around in their bank accounts with no interest on it to give Hashflare a try. 
As a Christmas treat, you can sign up here and get 10% bonus payouts each time you get paid out.

I wish you all a successful conclusion to the year, a peaceful holiday and a healthy and prosperous start to 2018.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Even after recent price increase (BTC for $220/TH) still most profitable option out there with trustworthy name, even better than Antminer. Count with electricity fees and incl. withdrawal fee mark down something around 14-18% from profit shown on Dashboard. Contract valid only 1 year. Reinvest earnings into more hashpower, again valid 1 year. Simple and easy FAQ on their site will lead you through. All depends on actual BTC price.

I can send you calculator on how much will you get by days ahead, write me zdenek.foukal@gmail.com

		<description><![CDATA[There is two thing about hashflare, that I don&#039;t like. Their support which could take 5+ days because hashflare is getting popular, and the withdraw system, because bitcoin network is getting too congested, other than its a great cloud mining site, I love the sign up link https://hashflare.io/r/342068EB-christmas 
because it gives us 10% more btc, that&#039;s a lot when you really think about it. The payouts with hashflare are amazing you looking to get your investment back in 2 months if you use the link, or a little over 3 months without, either way, it&#039;s still a short time on getting your money back, then full profit from there.

		<description><![CDATA[Honest review: Hashflare has been doing pretty well lately, Their payouts have been quite amazing tbh, I am topping at $240 a day, it should be like $190 but I used the bonus payout link https://hashflare.io/r/342068EB-christmas
I will keep it real, hashflare&#039;s support sucks, it takes time for them to solve any issue you have. They got customizable pools, I honestly suggest putting it to AntPool when you sign up, I feel like you get the most profit with them. The bitcoin withdrawals take a few hours. Overal hashflare isn&#039;t a scam overall, They pay well and RoI has been a long time ago.

		<description><![CDATA[Best investment I ever made. Stay with SHA-256 which is the most profitable. 
Go to this website to calculate your estimated ROI: https://www.coinwarz.com/calculators/bitcoin-mining-calculator/?h=340&#038;p=2600.00&#038;pc=0.10&#038;pf=0.00&#038;d=1452839779145.92000000&#038;r=12.50000000&#038;er=7346.00000000&#038;hc=0.00
You can play with the numbers depending on the amount of Hash rate you buy but most importantly, you can even play with the value of Bitcoin and edit this amount. Considering some negativity from people not understanding what Bitcoin is all about, I decided to lower the value of BTC to $10,000.00 in this calculator, then input my investment amount as &quot;hardware&quot; the hashrate bought, use zero values for both powers and use a 20% pool fees, then hit &quot;calculate&quot; and see where this takes you. You are still profitable under this scenario. Then go back and input the actual value of BTC and see it updated.

Happy investing to all! This is the future. Feel free to join clicking the link below.

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with below they keep posting, as of this morning the min amount for ETH cash out is 0.1

As in the past I was able to regularly 0.001, I know we are small fries compared to the big whales, but its our money...we paid for the server. Compared to others their interface is good. But why should I invest in bigger mining contracts? as far as I now...if they raised the minimum to 0.1 ETH they can soon raise again to 5 ETH and so on...watch out...

&quot;s the workload required to complete the payouts is significantly higher right now, the process now runs from 00:00 to 13:00 UTC.&quot;



&quot;Alberto Y Acuna, 9. December 2017
I have 0.00443109 BTC to withdrawall
Theirs said minimun to withdrawall is 0.0115
When click on withdrawall Read: No enough funds
Ridiculus. The amount to withdrawall is much more that the minimun
This is a SCAM. Theirs not answer the Tickets and no give a solution&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[*Honest Hashflare Review!*

I bought 5 TH of SHA-256 just shy of 1 year ago . My Verdict, it is truely a great product, great returns, especially if you decide to reinvest your funds. After the first 1.5 Months your initial investment would have been covered, from then on, all returns are profit (If you decide to withdraw). 
I highly recommend reinvesting, as Albert Einstein once said &quot;Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world&quot;. I have made over $10000 from a simple $750 investment, that being because I reinvested. 

Only downside is that the initial investment lasts for 1 year, rather than being an open ended investment. 

If you wish to get involved, use my referral link! You should receive a 10 % bonus on your initial purchase, which would be silly to miss out on.

		<description><![CDATA[ETH Miner point of view: I went to HF looking for another option to Gen... There were stable and platform looked good. Now with the whole BTC crazy, they keep raising and lowering the withdraw limits and I am only mining ETH. Payment was received and fees are ok, but, the raising and lowering of min payment amounts is getting out of control.

There are always messages: 

&quot;Dear users,
Creating new Bitcoin withdrawal requests is temporarily disabled due to a very large number of not broadcasted and/or unconfirmed transactions still pending on the side our provider, block.io. Read more from our newsletter here.&quot;

OR

&quot;Dear users,
As the workload required to complete the payouts is significantly higher right now, the process now runs from 00:00 to 13:00 UTC.&quot;

Some places like Nano pool min withdraw is 0.05 ETH, HF used to have withdraw at 0.001 ETH now jumped to 0.1 ETH. Yes still small for all the players that are coming in and area already in the market. For for someone that was is learning this up and down, lack of consistency on the withdraw, and slow support. Makes me start to looking back into Genesys or for a third option.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I suggest to stay alert from all new mining website.  Almost all in this period are scam. Hashflare seems to be legit and has an age. 
If you&#039;re interested in to join I suggest to use this discount code during every purchase or follow the link during registration:

https://hashflare.io/r/8FB4E262 (CODE: 8FB4E262) 

In the end i suggest to pay directly with cryptocurrency instead of credit card in order to start see your profit immediately after buy. Otherwise using credit card you&#039;ll have to wait around 30 days in order to start earn, this because they have to be sure to receive your payment.

Happy mining!]]></description>
